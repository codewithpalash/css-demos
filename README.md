# CSS Demos

This is a collection of CSS demos based on my YouTube videos on my channel, [Code with Palash](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnhIfN-A4JPs2ogiN59MRA). I hope this will help you to get the code and play around with it and to try it out yourself. Enjoy!

## My CSS Demos

- [How to Center Text Vertically and Horizontally in CSS](https://codewithpalash.github.io/css-demos/demos/center-text/)
- [How to change color of the input text cursor](https://codewithpalash.github.io/css-demos/demos/caret-color/)

I hope these demos will help you. If you like this repo and find it useful, please consider â˜… starring it.

Have a great day!
